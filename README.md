### black\_magic.decorator

This is intended to become a more modern and flexible replacement for the
the well known [decorator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator/3.4.0)
module. This module benefits an API for more flexible usage. The behaviour
of the [decorator](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/decorator/3.4.0) module can
easily be duplicated.
